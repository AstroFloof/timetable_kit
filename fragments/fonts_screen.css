NOTE: Most PDF viewers display PDFs at the wrong size.
Okular, for instance, is only "correct" size if displayed at 90%!
Screen fonts are probably OK for print as well.

I like the look of DejaVu Sans.
Other fonts to consider include Quicksand (pretty, art-decoish)
and Liberation Sans (good, but uglier I think)
