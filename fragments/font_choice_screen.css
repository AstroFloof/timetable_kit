NOTE: Most PDF viewers display PDFs at the wrong size.
Okular, for instance, is only "correct" size if displayed at 90%!
Screen fonts are probably OK for print as well.

I like the look of DejaVu Sans.  It seems the most reliable.

Other fonts to consider include Quicksand (pretty, art-decoish)
and Liberation Sans (good, but uglier I think)
Roboto is clean and good and small sizes; narrower than Deja Vu.
B612 is also worth considering

    Amtrak's old timetables were basically 6 pt, or maybe even smaller
    But that's unnecessarily grim for screen use, or even print use perhaps.
    The WAVE accessibility checker complains about sizes less than 13.75 px / 10.35pt
    10.35pt is the minimum for DejaVu Sans (given that smaller text is at 80%)
