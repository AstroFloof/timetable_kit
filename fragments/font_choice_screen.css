Spartan is best.
Spartan-MB is a new version but lines are taller.

-- "cursive" backup font-family tells us "Font didn't load".  Not a real backup family. FIXME

Note: Pandas Styler can't assign extra classes to the column heading:
must use .col_heading for selector 

We set the font for the entire table at once; it can be overridden in the cells.

Also ".symbol-key td" is a data cell IN the symbol key;
while ".tt-table td" is a data cell IN the main timetable.

.tt-table, .symbol-key {
    font-family: "Spartan", cursive;
}
