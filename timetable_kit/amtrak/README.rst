Amtrak Subpackage
*****************

This contains python modules which are entirely specific to Amtrak.

Right now the timetable_kit package is really only designed to make
Amtrak timetables, but the hope is that the rest of the package can 
be made indepenent of Amtrak, with the Amtrak-specific stuff here.
