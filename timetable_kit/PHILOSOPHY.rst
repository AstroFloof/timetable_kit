TIMETABLE PHILOSOPHY
====================

* Timetable presentation is an art form.  It cannot be fully automated.
* The goal is to present a very large amount of information in a tiny space, so that the human reader can extract the information they need at a glance.
* A timetable is akin to a report from a database: a display of information to meet particular needs.
* The same routes and trips (data in the database) will appear in different timetables in different presentations, just as the same database data appears differently in different reports.
* Timetable_kit's philosophy is to allow the user to design a timetable the way they would design a top-quality manual timetable -- but without having to do the tedious copying and pasting of times.
