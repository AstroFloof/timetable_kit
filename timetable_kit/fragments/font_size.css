This is the base font size. Since other stuff is relative to it, it should go *first*.

Amtrak timetables traditionally used very small fonts to fit in lots of data: 6 pt.

Note that common ligatures like "ffi" look muddy in tiny fonts, so disable them
with "font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;" if the font size is tiny.
