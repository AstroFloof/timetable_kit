Via Rail has separate stop_code (human-readable) and stop_id (strictly internal)

Via Rail has a number of mystery routes which have NO trip_short_name.
This is... OK... but these will be inaccessible with current timetable_kit design.
These are all from connecting service routes, so that's OK, leave them out for now.
Some may not actually even exist.  They are all in Quebec.

Handle with "connecting service" database?

Alternatively, patch the feed, it's a short list.

Regie intermunicipale de transport de la Gaspesie - Iles de la Madeline (REGIM)
Gaspe - Campbellton.

Train de La Malbaie / Train de Quebec -- probably both really Train de Charlevoix
Baie-Saint-Paul, La Malbaie (first one)
Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec-Chutes-Montmorency (second one)

Via Rail Air Connect -- goes between Dorval and Trudeau airport in Montreal.
This one we actually do want to describe.

... but it runs "every 45 minutes to 60 minutes".  It uses frequencies.txt.
This is not something we can implement in a "timetable" fashion.  We won't try.
