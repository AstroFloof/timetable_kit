Before release of timetables:
1 -- Print service dates on timetable.  See service_dates_from_trip_id.
2 -- Improve title and heading on the page.
3 -- add "days of week" special row

Preferably before release of timetables:
6 -- look up tt-aux and tt-spec files in a subdirectory, and develop
     code for running multiple timetables at once (save on setup costs)
7 -- Restructure to eliminate a slow lookup from trip_short_name to trip_id.
     get_timepoint in particular is running slow inside an inner loop.
     This is the lowest-hanging remaining fruit.

Fine for after release of timetables:
8 -- Detect first_station / last_station. ***

9 -- Routine to print out calendar for a single route,
     with out-of-period dates removed, for inspection

10 -- Make inline icon variants

11 -- Resolve other problematic directory references
12 -- Resolve command-line functions in amtrak/ into a __main__.py

13 -- Handle two trains in one column (oooglay)

14 -- Improve calendar filtering for days of week
    Still not clear what the best approach for this is.

    Failing to filter for the days of the week can give two calendars
    or zero, where I'm looking for one.

    Amtrak, upsettingly, has a lot of weird one-day service calendars.
    These are best described as "confusing".  This messed up the CONO
    timetable generator for 20220312.

    To make matters worse, there are calendar gaps in other timetables,
    like the Cardinal one.  We need a better presentation on this crap.
