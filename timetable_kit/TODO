1 -- Coast Starlight has different timetables in GTFS on Saturday only -- BUT THEY ARE IDENTICAL
    Which is absolutely ridiculous.  Find a workaround.  Merge identical timetables?

Yeah, merge identical timetables.  Or hand-edit the calendar table?

2 -- Day filter.  Coast Starlight has different timetables on Saturday only (!?!?!?!)
    Despite the same train number.  This is futzing up Coast Starlight timetable attempts

Recently discovered issues:
2 -- Find a way to sanitize the GTFS to remove totally-duplicated trips
3 -- Update the font to inlcude the standard Unicode arrows (2937, 2193, 2191, etc)


Fine for after release of timetables:
1 -- combine find_trains.py and find_connecting_buses.py, which share excessive amounts of logic.
2 -- improve icon situation

3 -- make silent links that don't turn blue and underline themselves.

4 -- Routine to print out calendar for a single route,
     with out-of-period dates removed, for inspection

5 -- Test install and resolve other problematic directory references

6 -- Resolve command-line functions in amtrak/ into a __main__.py

8 -- Improve calendar filtering for days of week
    Still not clear what the best approach for this is.

    Failing to filter for the days of the week can give two calendars
    or zero, where I'm looking for one.

    Amtrak, upsettingly, has a lot of weird one-day service calendars.
    These are best described as "confusing".  This messed up the CONO
    timetable generator for 20220312.

    To make matters worse, there are calendar gaps in other timetables,
    like the Cardinal one.  We need a better presentation on this crap.

9 -- Sanitize pathnames coming from command line and environment.
    We're very sloppy right now.
