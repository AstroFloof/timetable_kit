Internal cleanup:
1 -- memoize connecting services initialization (& wrapperize the dict)
     so that it doesn't run from auxillary progs like find_trains.py.

For generalizing to non-Amtrak feeds *better*:
-------
1 -- Switch wheelchair access detection to be based on GTFS.
     Write a routine to patch Amtrak's GTFS based on the wheelchair access detection
     from the Amtrak stations database.
2 -- Write "generic agency" code (largely based on VIA), then have Amtrak & VIA inherit from it

Clean up other "working" timetables: - TEDIOUS
- NEC

Build VIA timetables:
- Everything except Maple Leaf

Add arrows to the font -- follow up with designer on commission
- The arrows are currently pulled from Noto Sans Symbols via "backup font" method.
- We should have custom arrows.

For prettiness:
1 -- get the "sleeper" symbol printing (the icon and hooks are ready)

For internal code cleanup:
1 -- lean on pre-existing code in GTFS_kit where possible (restrict_*)

California Zephyr
NOTE ! NOTE ! NOTE !
Richmond CA is not handicapped accessible until at LEAST Jan 3 2023 -- check San Joaquins site
for details

Capitol Corridor
NOTE ! NOTE ! NOTE !
Amtrak station *is* at Chase Bank -- official State of California CC timetable still lists it as Salesforce Transit Plaza, incorrectly

Broken due to GTFS breakage:
- Winter Park Express
- Vermont to Upstate NY
- Southwest Chief
- Lincoln Service (ibid)
- Quincy (ibid)
- Grand Canyon (ibid)
- Heartland Flyer (ibid)
- Empire Service
- Maple Leaf
- Ethan Allen Express
- Capitol Corridor - Ghost buses (weekday is done, weekend is half done)
Not running:
- Adirondack

Put off, because these have printable state agency timetables, or almost:
- San Joaquins
- Pacific Surfliner
- Cascades - Oregon Point bus schedule problem
- Downeaster
- Hartford Line

When new GTFS drops:
1 -- Southwest Chief (currently missing entirely)
2 -- add Southwest Chief back into Lincoln Service
3 -- add Southwest Chief back into Quincy Service
4 -- Maple Leaf back to Canada / Empire Service (currently very buggy)
5 -- Ethan Allen Express to Burlington
6 -- then recheck everything else

Fine for after release of timetables:
1 -- consider adding "Route name" notation based on location of Station column (see Hartford Line)

2 -- Routine to print out calendar for a single route,
     with out-of-period dates removed, for inspection

3 -- Test install and resolve other problematic directory references

4 -- Resolve command-line functions in amtrak/ & via/ into a __main__.py

5 -- Improve calendar filtering for days of week
    Still not clear what the best approach for this is.

    Failing to filter for the days of the week can give two calendars
    or zero, where I'm looking for one.

    Amtrak, upsettingly, has a lot of weird one-day service calendars.
    These are best described as "confusing".  This messed up the CONO
    timetable generator for 20220312.

    To make matters worse, there are calendar gaps in other timetables,
    like the Cardinal one.  We need a better presentation on this crap.

6 -- Sanitize pathnames coming from command line and environment.
    We're very sloppy right now.

7 -- add a way to specify "special CSS" in the JSON, in order to avoid duplicative work in the CSV.
      Basically allow a CSS class, or several, to be embedded in the JSON and referenced in the CSV.

Fine for never:
8 -- implement prototype spec generator using toposort to merge station lists.
     This is really a many-step process.

Wishlist:
9 -- "Reverse style" timetables with stations on top and trains on the left.  This would just be cool.
(OK.  It would be AWESOME.)

CSS Paged Media project:
- Unique table IDs.
Allows header styling to work on multiple timetables in same HTML document.
- Move font selection out of CSS jinja substitutions (somehow).
This allows two unrelated HTML timetable pages to share the same CSS,
which is needed to generate multipage HTML directly.

Long term (?):
- Patch PANDAS to allow insertion of classes in header rows.
- This seems straightforward.
- tests/io/format is where the test is.
- need a parallel to cell_context (header_context).
- Have to set up another project contributor profile etc so OMG.  Not this month.
