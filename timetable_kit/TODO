1 -- "Key On Side" design -- needed for EB

2 -- Remove "Amtrak Station" suffix on stations, as it is stupid

Fine for after release of timetables:
1 -- improve icon situation

2 -- Detect first_station / last_station. ***

3 -- make silent links that don't turn blue and underline themselves.

4 -- Routine to print out calendar for a single route,
     with out-of-period dates removed, for inspection

5 -- Test install and resolve other problematic directory references

6 -- Resolve command-line functions in amtrak/ into a __main__.py

7 -- Handle two trains in one column (oooglay)

8 -- Improve calendar filtering for days of week
    Still not clear what the best approach for this is.

    Failing to filter for the days of the week can give two calendars
    or zero, where I'm looking for one.

    Amtrak, upsettingly, has a lot of weird one-day service calendars.
    These are best described as "confusing".  This messed up the CONO
    timetable generator for 20220312.

    To make matters worse, there are calendar gaps in other timetables,
    like the Cardinal one.  We need a better presentation on this crap.

9 -- Sanitize pathnames coming from command line and environment.
    We're very sloppy right now.
