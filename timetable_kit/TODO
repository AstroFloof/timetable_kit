For generalizing to non-Amtrak feeds:
1 -- Switch wheelchair access detection to be based on GTFS.
     Write a routine to patch Amtrak's GTFS based on the wheelchair access detection
     from the Amtrak stations database.
2 -- Find a way to grab station names from Amtrak if available (Advanced Information),
     but from GTFS if not available.
3 -- Design a program to merge two GTFS databases.  Deal with the Hartford Line's use of
     a different stop_id (ST) for New Haven State Street than Amtrak's stop_id (STS).
     This is really entirely for Hartford Line.
4 -- Give the Amtrak module interface a defined (duck) type, so that we can
     swap in a different module.  This is easier to do than it appears!
     We can literally just use a variable to hold which module to call.

For internal code cleanup:
0 -- lean on pre-existing code in GTFS_kit where possible (restrict_*)
1 -- combine find_trains.py and find_connecting_buses.py, which share excessive amounts of logic.
2 -- improve icon situation (put characters in font?)
3 -- Update the font to inlcude the standard Unicode arrows (2937, 2193, 2191, etc)

Fine for after release of timetables:
1 -- Add Roanoke service to Crescent timetable?

4 -- Routine to print out calendar for a single route,
     with out-of-period dates removed, for inspection

5 -- Test install and resolve other problematic directory references

6 -- Resolve command-line functions in amtrak/ into a __main__.py

8 -- Improve calendar filtering for days of week
    Still not clear what the best approach for this is.

    Failing to filter for the days of the week can give two calendars
    or zero, where I'm looking for one.

    Amtrak, upsettingly, has a lot of weird one-day service calendars.
    These are best described as "confusing".  This messed up the CONO
    timetable generator for 20220312.

    To make matters worse, there are calendar gaps in other timetables,
    like the Cardinal one.  We need a better presentation on this crap.

9 -- Sanitize pathnames coming from command line and environment.
    We're very sloppy right now.
