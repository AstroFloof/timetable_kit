README-logos.rst
================
Part of timetable_kit

This directory contains logos for various transit agencies.
Most are believed to be public domain but trademarked.

These are used solely for the fair-use informational purpose of
showing that this transit agency offers connecting service at a
particular station.  If a transit agency complains, we will simply
replace their logo with a logo of our own design referring to them.

In fact, we may have to do that in any case for agencies with logos
which are unreadable in small print.
