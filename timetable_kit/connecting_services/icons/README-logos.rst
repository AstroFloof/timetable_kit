README-logos.rst
================
Part of timetable_kit

This directory contains logos for various transit agencies.
Most are believed to be public domain but trademarked.
Some may be copyrighted and trademarked.

These are used solely for the fair-use informational purpose of
showing that this transit agency offers connecting service at a
particular station, so copyright should not be an issue.

If a transit agency complains, we will simply replace their 
logo with a logo of our own design referring to them.

In fact, we may have to do that in any case for agencies with logos
which are unreadable in small print.

NFTA_Metro.ai
-------------
Found on brandsoftheworld.com/logo/nfta-metro.
Will need simplification and work to be usable in this context.

NJT
---
NJT's policy stated on their website is that they don't allow people
to use their logo.

Their logo sucks anyway and is painful to work with.
We'll make our own, I guess.

MARC_train.svg
--------------
From Wikipedia, stated to be public domain.

Baltimore_Light_RailLink_logo.svg
---------------------------------
From Wikipedia, public domain because in Maryland Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
