Part of timetable_kit

This directory contains logos for various transit agencies.

None of the logos are part of timetable_kit proper; they are not subject to its copyright.

Most are believed to be public domain but trademarked.
Some may be copyrighted and trademarked.

Since they are being used informationally to refer to the agencies, they are
being used in full compliance with all trademark laws.

These are used solely for the fair-use informational purpose of
showing that this transit agency offers connecting service at a
particular station, so copyright should not be an issue.

For the most part, these logos are used by Wikipedia for exactly the same purpose.

If a transit agency complains, we will remove their logo and refer to them
with a plaintext acronym or abbreviation.

We already have to do that for agencies with logos which are unreadable in small print.

The CSS files are part of timetable_kit, and are basically alignment and sizing adjustments
to make the logos as readable as possible given the extreme space constraints of the timetable.

Added to the Rapid Transit icons category by me, after finding them:
====================================================================

CT_Rail_logo_black.svg
----------------------
We use a modified version with just the icon, for compactness.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CT_Rail_logo_black.svg

NJT_NJ_Symbol.svg
-----------------
This is the "NJ" rather than the three stripes.
From here: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NJT_NJ_Symbol.svg


MARC_train.svg
--------------
From https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MARC_train.svg
Also from Wikipedia, but this is the full version used in the header of the webpage.
Public domain because it's in the Maryland State Manual of Traffic Control devices!


WMATA_Metro_Logo_small.svg
--------------------------
(icon without words, better)

Tri-Rail.svg
------------
From https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tri-Rail_logo.svg
This is the full logo with the words.

MDTMetro.svg
------------
Miami Metrorail, as used on Wikipedia.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MDTMetro.svg

Metra_Logo.svg
--------------
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metra_Logo.svg

St_Louis_MetroLink_Logo.svg
---------------------------
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Louis_MetroLink_Logo.svg

"TEX partial logo.svg"
--------------------------
The agency no longer uses a logo at all.
This variant is used by Wikipedia on its maps.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trinity_Metro_TEX_only.svg


Regional_Transportation_District_logo.svg
------------------------------------------
Denver.  Official is white on red in a square.
This variant is used by Wikipedia on its maps.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Regional_Transportation_District_logo.svg


UTA_icon.svg
-------------
Without the letters "U T A".
This variant is used by Wikipedia on its maps.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UTA_icon.svg

Metro_Minnesota_logo.svg
------------------------
Metro Transit has stupidly restrictive text on their webpage, asking for a photo credit
to Metro Transit and purporting to restrict re-creations, which is unacceptable, so don't use this.
This is the version from Wikipedia, in case they stop being stupid some day.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metro_Minnesota_logo.svg

Sound_Transit logos
------------------------------
Without the words.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sound_Transit_logo_simplified.svg
Sounder.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sound_Transit_Sounder_logo.svg
Link.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sound_Transit_Link_Light_Rail_logo.svg

TriMet_icon.svg
----------------
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TriMet_icon.svg


2022_Metrolink_logo.svg
------------------------
Metrolink (LA) changed their logo in 2022.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2022_Metrolink_Logo.svg


Sacramento_Regional_transit.svg
-------------------------------
From https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sacramento_Regional_Transit.svg

Sacramento_new_logo.svg
-----------------------
The website shows they've abandoned the blue background.  We modified the above
logo from Wikipedia to do the same thing.  Unfortunately, yellow shows up really badly
on a white background, so we stick with the old logo.


SPRINTER_logo.svg
-----------------
This is the word logo.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SPRINTER_logo.svg

There's also this icon, but it's a PNG -- eeewww.
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sprinter_San_Diego.png

MTS_Trolley_icon.svg
--------------------
San Diego Trolley
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MTS_Trolley_icon.svg


Additional logos
================

CT_Rail_icon_only.svg
---------------------
Derived from CT_Rail_logo_black.svg, but with just the icon and with extra whitespace removed.

PATH_logo_cleaned.svg
---------------------
Derived from PATH.svg, but with just the icon (no word) and with extra whitespace removed.

NJT_logo_cleaned.svg
--------------------
This is the same as NJT_logo with whitespace removed from top and bottom for better printing.

Virginia_Railway_Express_cleaned.svg
------------------------------------
Again, whitespace removed.

dc_street_logo.svg
-------------------
DC Streetcar logo from their website.  It isn't a real SVG!  It has an embedded bitmap.

dc_street_logo.png
-------------------
The bitmap extracted from the above "fake" SVG

dc_street_logo_working.svg
--------------------------
My copy for tracing the PNG

dc_street_logo_reduced.svg
---------------------------
Just the "DC" letters.
The streetcar image is unreadable at small sizes.
The entire "DC Streetcar" word logo is too long; there's too many connecting services at DC already.
The "DC" logo is distinctive and short enough.

Tri-Rail_icon.svg
-----------------
This is just the icon, extracted from the full logo by me

NORTA.svg
---------
Downloaded from https://www.norta.com/Content/images/logo-map-interaction.svg

Metra_Logo_no_slogan.svg
------------------------
Metra_Logo.svg with the slogan removed (since it's unreadable at this print size)

qline-logo-wt.svg
------------------
Taken from the QLine webpage on 30 Dec 2022.  It's white!

qline-logo-red.svg
------------------
Converted to be "QLine red" by me.  The webpage color is #DB001C.

qline-logo-red-no-detroit.svg
-----------------------------
Remove the "Detroit" because it's too small to read at this size.

RideKC_Streetcar_logo.svg
-------------------------
From the Wikipedia page for the KC Streetcar.
This is much too large for our purposes, we just want the icon.
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/RideKC_Streetcar_logo.svg

RideKC_Streetcar_icon.svg
--------------------------
Extracted from the above.
This is too muddy for our purposes.

RideKC_Streetcar_short.svg
---------------------------
Has "RideKC" but not the overly-long word "Streetcar".
Fits with the KC Streetcar brand standards and managable for our purpose.

TRE_logo.png
------------
From https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TRE_logo.png
We do not use PNGs.

TRE_logo_working.svg
---------------------
Traced in Inkscape -- working file.  (Yeech.)

TRE_logo_reduced.svg
---------------------
Reduced SVG file, usable.


NMRX_logo.svg
--------------
Extracted from the PDF timetable from the RailRunner website, using Karbon and Inkscape.
