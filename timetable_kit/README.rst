What's Here
***********

This is the directory for the actual timetable_kit package.
In python packaging style, this is always a subdirectory of the source control system
root directory (I don't know why, but I'll follow the style.)

timetable.py contains the main program.  It should be executed at the command line.

NOTES contains various notes on things learned, work in progress, etc.

tt-spec-documentation.txt contains documentation on the tt-spec format
and future plans for it.

This is an unfinished work in progress.  It has not yet had a release and does not yet
have version numbers.
