Specific code to create a properly-aligned internal "pseudo-table" within each
cell which displays time (and date, and discharge-only, etc.)

This does the actual time part.
This is the "simple" version: really wants a tabular-nums font.

Now, we want to use "ch" widths -- but they fail horribly!
Weasyprint makes them too NARROW and overwrites the columns;
Firefox makes them too WIDE and leaves tons of extra space.

We'll try "em"s.  These work, but, uh... yuck?
We probably should do more tricks.  TODO.
