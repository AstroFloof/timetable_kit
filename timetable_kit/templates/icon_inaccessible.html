This is the HTML fragment to refer to the INaccessibility icon, 
for use in the access column in a timetable.

This is referenced from icons.py

aria-label will be read by a screenreader,
while aria-hidden hides the entire thing and its interior.
- We want alt to be a single letter for printing when icons are missing
- We want aria-label, which will be read by a screenreader, to be like title

We don't want to clutter up the screen reader with the single letter if possible.
