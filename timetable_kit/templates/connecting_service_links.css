Remove the underline and blue color from connecting service (non-logo) links
and style them in a "logo-like" boldface.

This must be specific to a. in order to override normal link coloring.

The second definition is for use when we don't want this to be a link,
but we still want it to look exactly the same

/* This makes sure that there are no line breaks between the logo
and its definition (a single key item) or between a logo and its suffix. */
