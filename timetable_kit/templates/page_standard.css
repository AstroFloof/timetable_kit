CSS Jinja template file related to the full page layout, rather than to individual tables.

The @page directives are respected by Weasyprint.

Letter size:
8.5in = 215.9mm
11 in = 279.4mm

A4 is 210mm x 297mm; longer but narrower.

If we use letter with 10 mm (1 cm) margin on each side,
we should avoid overflowing the width of A4 (since 215.9 - 10 = 205.9 < 210).

{# Sooo.  We would like to do these in .tt-page, but we can't:
    break-before: page; -- Firefox will stuff a blank page before it, on printing
    break-after: page; -- Firefox will stuff a blank page after it, on printing
   Thankfully avoiding page breaks inside is Good Enough.
   We don't need to use old style either: weasyprint, firefox, and chrome all handle new style.

Warning to check the agency (Amtrak, VIA) site before buying tickets.

Layout of the main timetable and the symbol key / footnotes.
Timetable is in ".bigbox-timetable";
Symbol key and footnotes are in ".bigbox-keys";
both are contained within ".bigbox-layout".

Normally the symbol key / footnotes are at the bottom.
With key_on_right, line these up side by side, somehow!

The secret is to use flexbox layout

    display: flex;

    flex-shrink: 0; /* Never shrink the timetable, always shrink the key instead */

    flex-shrink: 1; /* Always shrink the key */
    flex-grow: 1; /* Grow the key if there's room */

Layout for "key below table" layouts; simpler

TODO FIXME
This could be done with display: flex; and flex-direction: column;

Compression of credits. Used on timetables where space is at a premium.

Affects credits, bottom_text, connecting services key, and unofficial_agency disclaimer.
