This is the base font size. Since other stuff is relative to it, it should go *first*.

Amtrak timetables traditionally used very small fonts to fit in lots of data: 6 pt.
Jinja2 template substitution fills in the actual font size, ("6pt").

Note that common ligatures like "ffi" look muddy in tiny fonts, so disable them
with "font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;" if the font size is tiny.

services_header_text and timezone_header_text are both spans in a header, which usually has enlarged fonts,
but should have the same tiny font as the rest of the timetable.

Before setting the entire timetable, we did the following:
.tt-table, .symbol-key, .timetable_kit_credit, .services-header-text {

Then we tried this:
body, .services-header-text, .access-header-text, .timezone-header-text {

Multi-page timetables: this is a bit ugly because we may want to vary this *per timetable*.
Attach the font size clause to a CSS class in a div which wraps the timetable.

Still need special references to the three header texts which should not be enlarged.
It is not clear how to change them for multi-page timetables with variations, since this would
need to be done from Python code.  FIXME

For now all timetables in a multi-page must use the same font size
