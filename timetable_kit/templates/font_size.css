This is the base font size. Since other stuff is relative to it, it should go *early*.
(This is tricky since it's per page.)

Amtrak timetables traditionally used very small fonts to fit in lots of data: 6 pt.
Jinja2 template substitution fills in the actual font size, ("6pt").

Note that common ligatures like "ffi" look muddy in tiny fonts, so disable them
with "font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;" if the font size is tiny.
These are eliminated from SpartanTT so we don't need this disabled for that font;
SpartanTT only has ff and ft ligatures, which are readable.  Consider whether to
re-enable ligatures.

services_header_text, access_header_text, and timezone_header_text are spans in a header.
The header usually has enlarged fonts, but these should have the same tiny font as the rest of the timetable.

Check on CSS priority and specificity when it comes to font sizes; this can get ugly!
