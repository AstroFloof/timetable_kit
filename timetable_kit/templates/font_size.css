This is the base font size. Since other stuff is relative to it, it should go *first*.

Amtrak timetables traditionally used very small fonts to fit in lots of data: 6 pt.
Jinja2 template substitution fills in the actual font size, ("6pt").

Note that common ligatures like "ffi" look muddy in tiny fonts, so disable them
with "font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;" if the font size is tiny.

services_header_text is in a span in a header, which usually has enlarged fonts,
but should have the same tiny font as the rest of the timetable.
