This is the HTML fragment to explain the logo of a specific connecting service,
for use in the key in a timetable.  It's actually quite complicated.

This is referenced from connecting_services/

Note that title does not show on an img inside an <a> link,
and also doesn't show on the <a> link.

Therefore we don't make the logo into a link here, so the title will show

connecting-service-logo-key will:
-- suppress internal linebreaks in the span
connecting-service-link will:
-- suppress blue/underlinked anchor, and boldface instead
#}{#
#}<span class="connecting-service-logo-key">{# Forces no linebreaks within this span
#}<span class="connecting-service-link">{# Print this exactly the same way as in the link (boldface)
#}{% if logo_filename %}{#
#}<img class="{{ class }}" src="logos/{{ svg_filename }}" alt="{{ alt }}" title="{{ title }}">{#
#}{% else %}{# No logo_filename available; use alt text; format same way as in link above
#}{{ alt }}{#
#}{% endif %}{#
#}{% if suffix %}{# Perhaps this is a logo *plus* a text suffix
#}{{ suffix }}{#
#}{% endif %}{#
#}</span>{# Close the connecting-service-link span
#} {# Single space, separating logo and definition -- CSS will enforce no linebreaks
#}<a href="{{ url }}">{# Normal URL, blue color and underline is OK
#}{{full_name}}{#
#}</a>{#
#}</span>{# Jinja is supposed to be smart enough to remove the last trailing newline in the file
#}
