This is the HTML fragment to explain the logo of a specific connecting service,
for use in the key in a timetable.  It's actually quite complicated.

This is referenced from connecting_services/

Note that title does not show on an img inside an <a> link,
and also doesn't show on the <a> link.

Therefore we don't make the logo into a link here, so the title will show

#}<span class="connecting-service-logo-key">{#
#}<span class="connecting-service-link">{# Print this exactly the same way as in the link (boldface)
#}{% if logo_filename %}{#
#}<img class="{{ class }}" src="logos/{{ svg_filename }}" alt="{{ alt }}" title="{{ title }}">{#
#}{% else %}{# No logo_filename available; use alt text; format same way as in link above
#}{{ alt_nbsp }}{# Note, non-breaking-space variant of alt text
#}{% endif %}{#
#}{% if suffix %}{# Perhaps this is a logo *plus* a text suffix
#}{{ suffix_nbsp }}{# Note, non-breaking-space variant of suffix
#}{% endif %}{#
