The following deals with an *extremely annoying* problem with PANDAS table styling.
While the rest of the table can be styled using custom classes, the headers can't.

The only way to style the header sections is through specific CSS selectors using
PANDAS's standard column names.

With multi-page timetables these MUST also be indexed by a table ID.  This is complicated enough
that we produce it in Python and just pass it through.
