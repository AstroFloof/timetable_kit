Jinja2 template substitution fills in the
font name (SpartanTT), and backup font name (sans-serif or cursive).

Spartan (Version 1.004) by Matt Bailey is the best I've found.
(Spartan-MB is version 1.006 but lines are taller and characters narrower.)

SpartanTT is my hacked version of Spartan 1.004 with:
-- alternate "a" from 1.006
-- tabular nums which are the same width in medium and bold.

* The "cursive" backup font-family tells us "Font didn't load".  Not a real backup family. FIXME

We set the font for the entire table at once; it can be overridden in the cells.
This sets the font for the timetable, for the symbol_key, and for the credit.

TODO: set the font for the entire page.

#}
.tt-table, .symbol-key, .timetable_kit_credit {
    font-family: "{{ font_name }}", {{ backup_font_name }};
}
