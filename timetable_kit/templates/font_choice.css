Jinja2 template substitution fills in the
font name (SpartanTT), and backup font name (sans-serif or cursive).

Spartan (Version 1.004) by Matt Bailey is the best I've found.
(Spartan-MB is version 1.006 but lines are taller and characters narrower.)

SpartanTT is my hacked version of Spartan 1.004 with:
-- alternate "a" from 1.006
-- tabular nums which are the same width in medium and bold.

We set the font for the entire page at once, by applying to the <div> with the page in it.
#}
/* Applies to the <div> for the page */
#{{page_id}} {
    font-family: "{{ font_name }}", {{ backup_font_name }};
}
