SPARTAN TT (New Version)
------------------------

I (Nathanael Nerode) commissioned Matt Bailey to make a variant of Spartan suitable for my needs.

SPARTAN 1.004
-------------
Matt Bailey's Spartan was the best font I have found for displaying small-print timetables
-- with some caveats.

The "fonts/upstream" directory contains the version of Spartan I downloaded from Google Fonts.
This is a free font under the Open Font License 1.1.
This is unpacked as Spartan.  (An alternate version is partially unpacked as Spartan1004.)

This is version *1.004* by Matt Bailey and Mirko Velimirovic.  It's on their github site,
but you have to download the 1.004 version.  The newer versions are not acceptable.  

In small print, this version has shorter, wider characters than the more recent 1.006 version of Spartan.

This is highly, highly desirable for readability, and for fitting more lines into the 
timetable: it is substantially superior to other versions for my purposes.  That's why I'm saving it here.

However, Spartan does not come with tabular numerals.

In addition, the "a" is hard to distinguish from "o" in small font sizes.

SPARTAN TT (Old Version)
------------------------
So I (Nathanael Nerode) created a variant (SpartanTT) which has tabular numerals as an option.
For now, I've only done the Medium and Bold versions, since that's what I'm using.
The FontForge files are in the fonts folder with .sfd suffix.

The tabular numbers are monospaced across ***all*** weights, so weights can be used interchangeably.
The letters "A" and "P" also have tabular number variants.
So does the colon ":" -- so that a Bold colon will line up with a Medium colon
-- though the colon is half-width (I am considering doing the same with the period and comma).

In addition, I ported the alternate "a" from Spartan 1.006 back to 1.004
(recovering 1.004 advance width and height, but not fixing the narrow stroke width issues).
This is hoped to be slightly more readable.  Because most browsers (including Chrome)
can't pick individual character variants, this becomes the standard version and the 
formerly-standard "a" becomes an alternate character.

This font is, of course, under the Open Font License 1.1, like the original Spartan.
