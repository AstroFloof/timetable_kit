Amtrak Cascades buses in Oregon have their GTFS data in the feed here:

* https://oregon-gtfs.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs_data/point-or-us/point-or-us.zip

because although they are exclusively ticketed through Amtrak, they are operated by:

* https://www.oregon-point.com/

This is confusing to the point of stupidity, but it may be possible to merge the feeds.
