Since I'm new to Python packaging, and it's very bizarre, this explains
how to hack on the timetable_kit package.

This complexity is necessary so that the scripts within the timetable_kit
package can actually find the timetable_kit package *as a module*.  Python
actually makes this extremely difficult.    

1. Make the venv directory:

python -m venv venv

2. Use it:

source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the current directory as an *editable* package search location:
(should be parent of the actual package directory)

pip install -e .

3A. It's probably wise to install MyPy for type checking.  MyPy must
be installed INSIDE the venv, and it needs some extra packages to do type checking:

pip install mypy
pip install pandas-stubs
pip install types-requests

3B. It's probably wise to install Black, though a system version of Black is fine too.

pip install black

4. Get out of the venv:

deactivate

5.  When you want to hack on it again, just activate the venv:

source venv/bin/activate
