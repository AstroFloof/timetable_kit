The HTML file can (and sometimes should) be converted to PDF.  
I am currently using WeasyPrint for this because it is also a Python package.

-- It is hard to test PDFs.  At least on my monitor...
--- Okular needs to be set at 90% zoom to show it real size.
--- Evince needs to be set at 50% zoom to show it real size.

Amtrak train numbers are in the "trip_short_name" field of GTFS static data
Amtrak station codes are in the "stop_id" field of GTFS static data.

Station full names are retrieved from the Amtrak station data on the Web which is on the web in json format;
the json files for the station data must be downloaded in advance, 
using './json_stations.py download' into the ./stations/ directory.
This is to avoid beating too hard on Amtrak's website.
