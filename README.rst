Timetable Kit
*************

Timetable Kit (timetable_kit) is a Python toolkit for generating human-readable timetables from `General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS>` data.

Development status
==================
This is currently a work in progress and not functional.
Initial development is focused on Amtrak timetables.

Dependencies
============
Timetable Kit was developed with Python 3.9.9, and may not work with earlier versions.
It relies on `GTFS Kit <https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfs_kit>` to parse GTFS.
Like GTFS Kit, it uses `PANDAS <https://pandas.pydata.org>` to do the heavy lifting.
It was tested with PANDAS 1.4.
