This folder contains icons used for timetable display.

These SVG images are all from Font Awesome Free.
In SVG form, they are subject to the CC BY 4.0 license, which requires only attribution.

The images had to be edited to add alt-text for screen readers.
This is done by adding a "title" field as the first child of the SVG.

They also had to be edited to wrap them to define a "symbol" to avoid duplication.  
That way, the "symbol" gets referenced.

I did this manually, though it might perhaps be worth doing it
programmatically.  So these are slightly modified from the downloaded icons.
